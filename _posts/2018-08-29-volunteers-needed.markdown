Hey everyone!
As development ramps up on the Xen for Android project, there is a growing need for porters and other contributers.
Unfortunately, xen4android is a massive undertaking for what currently amounts to 1 person.
Additionaly, with University this year looming over me, I (Josh Max) will not have as much time to develop for the project as I did over the summer.
In leu of this, I will be releasing my local codebase to GitHub over the coming weeks so that others can join the team and (hopefully) get this thing working on as much hardware as possible.
I've always had a vision that Xen for Android deserved _more_ than just my commits, so I figured it's time I assembled a proper team of loosely-knit hackers.

If you feel like you could be of use, by all means tell us about yourself in #xen4android on Freenode!
I also might set up a Telegram/Discord group, depending on popular opinion.

Stay tuned for more updates!
